# Binary-Search
Hello!
This is a collection of all of my code used to find the binary fraction of stars in APOGEE data. There is a Jupyter notebook that walks you through step by step what is done from the initial fits files to finding the final binary fraction in samples. 

If you have questions, comments, or compaints, please feel free to email me.
