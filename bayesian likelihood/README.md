# Bayesian Likelihood
This is a collection of files used to find the likelihood of binary fraction in some collection of data. Binary fraction is found creating a large sample of synthetic galaxies for varius binary fractions, then compares the real observations to find the model that gives the largest likelihood. 

There is a Jupyter Notebook that gives a short rundown on how to use the main programs. Each .py file should have a docstring at the begining of the program that explanes how the program works.
